# Combat Overhaul Reloaded
This version of COR is focused on performance, such as improved loading times and making weapons spawn their COR version when adding the mod. As you can already tell by the file size, I've cleaned up quite a few unused and redundant files. The original version of COR was nearly 43 MB and as of writing this we are at 37.6 MB nearly 40MB, While this may seem like very little change, do note that this version has been updated many many times adding new weapons, textures, training mods, and more.


COR Mod Update - Performance and Optimizations

This version of the COR mod is focused on performance, with key improvements such as faster loading times and optimizations for weapon spawning. When adding the mod, weapons now automatically spawn with their COR version for a smoother experience.
File Size Reduction

We've made significant strides in reducing the overall file size of the mod:

    Previous Version: 43 MB
    Current Version: 37.6 MB (nearly 40 MB)

While this reduction might seem small, it is the result of extensive cleanup. Many unused and redundant files have been removed, streamlining the mod without sacrificing content.
Ongoing Updates

Over the course of many updates, COR has been continually expanded with:

    New weapons
    Updated textures
    Enhanced training mods
    And much more!
    
While this version is very far behine COL at this point, many of the things i work on in COR go towards COL. If you enjoy COR, dont forget to check out COL

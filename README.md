# Combat Overhaul Reloaded
This version of COR is focused on performance, such as improved loading times and making weapons spawn their COR version when adding the mod. As you can already tell by the file size, I've cleaned up quite a few unused and redundant files. The original version of COR was nearly 43 MB and as of writing this we are at 37.6 MB nearly 40MB, While this may seem like very little change, do note that this version has been updated many many times adding new weapons, textures, training mods, and more.
